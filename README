# MDP Solver

This project can be divided into two parts, where each part 'basically' constitutes one class. 

The Init class translates a MDP formulation into a C++ class. The MDP class consists of all ingredients for the value iteration to solve the MDP formulated in the Init class. The algorithms used are optimised for a special MDP.
