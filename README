# MDP Solver #

This project can be divided into two parts, where each part 'basically' constitutes one class. 

The Init class depends on the application. The C++ class should define a full MDP formulation. The MDP class consists of all ingredients for the value iteration to solve the MDP formulated in the Init class. The algorithms used are optimised for a special MDP.
